    <p class="lead m-auto text-center">
      Updated line striping enhances safety and compliance. Clearly marked parking spaces, walkways, arrows, and loading zones reduce confusion and the risk of accidents—while also keeping your business up to ADA standards.
    </p>

    <p class="lead m-auto text-center">
      Proper striping also maximizes space and improves traffic flow. This is critical for busy properties like restaurants, shopping centers, and service businesses throughout Central MA that rely on clear, organized parking layouts.
